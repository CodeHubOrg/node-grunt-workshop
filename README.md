Introduction to Node & Grunt
============================

![alt text](http://gruntjs.com/img/grunt-logo.png "Grunt")

By the end of this workshop you will be able to:

 - Create a nodejs http server
 - Use the same javascript on client and server
 - Use package managers to handle all your external libraries
 - Use CommonJS to structure your javascript
 - Use JSHint to catch common javascript errors
 - Use Jasmine and Karma to unit test your code
 - Use Grunt to automate your build

How to use this material
------------------------

Starting from an empty folder, the lessons will incrementally create a full server, client and build system.

Each lesson has a readme.md describing the steps and sample code representing the goal end point. Do your best to build the system yourself by following the steps but if you get stuck or behind then feel free to dip in and borrow bits from the sample.

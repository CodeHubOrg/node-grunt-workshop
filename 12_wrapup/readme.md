Lesson 11 - Minify our javascript
=================================

Other grunt tasks I use

- Assemble - html templating with handlebars
- Typescript - type safe javascript
- Less - CSS templating toolkit
- Mongoose - Mongo interface library
- S3 - deploy static files to Amazon

Useful tasks

- using higher-level language e.g. coffescript, typescript
- version stamping files
- generating documentation
- deploying code to production
- zipping, encrypting bundles
- labelling version repository

Tips

- look at your workflow and pick off time-consuming sequences of tasks
- not limited to makefile terriority, think more broadly
- look at Bower for client side dependencies e.g. bootstrap

Whats good about grunt

- self-documenting build and deploy script
- versioned dependencies for your team/client
- plugins for every task imaginable
- flexible: quick to use and modify
- cross platform
- use JS for both front and backend

Areas of concern

- can get carried away with a long build process
- multiple plugin options for the same task, choose wisely
